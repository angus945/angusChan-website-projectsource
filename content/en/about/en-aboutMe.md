Hi, I'm from Taiwan. I'm nineteen years old and with great interest in game development and programming

because Taiwan height school is not for me, so I chose to Self-study

this meed I need to give up all of the resources from normal education, but instead, I can choice what to learn and how to learn freely.

I start by watching video on Udemy, step by step learning how to build a game and make some sample projects

Although I failed many project, but I accumulated tons of experinces and finally managed to finish my first project.

My first project is named "[Drop Throw Dungeon](https://angus945.itch.io/drop-throw-dungeon)". Although it just a simple prototype, but I know this project is a diamond in the rough. Hoping some day I can finish it.

Now, I'm making a new project, its name is "Operation Chough". this project has been made for a year. Our short-term goal is to join [Taipei Game Show](https://tgs.tca.org.tw/index_portal.php) in 2022, sot stay tuned for more information
