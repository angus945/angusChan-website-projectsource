Hi, I'm nineteen years old juvenile from Taiwan with, interest in game development and programming

because I'm not suitable for default education in Taiwan height school, so I chose the plan to let me can learn by my self at home

this meed I don't have any teacher can teach me, and I need to abandon all of the sources from height school, but now I have free choice for how about learning and learning direction :D

now I specialize in game development and start by tutorial from Udemy, after more them more develop exercise I try to begin some sample projects

Unfortunately, many projects are failed but, during those time I accumulation so much experience

my first finished project is "[Drop Throw Dungeon](https://angus945.itch.io/drop-throw-dungeon)", although it just a simple prototype but as long as some polished, it can be to the delicate work, hope I can finish it one day.
